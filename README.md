# Boston-housing-prediction-app

Overview
This Boston House Prediction App is a machine learning application that predicts the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston based on various input features. The application uses the Random Forest Regressor model to predict house prices based on a dataset and visualizes the predictions using Streamlit, a popular framework for building web apps.

Key features include:

Upload your own dataset of housing data.
Predict house prices based on user-defined inputs.
Visualize feature importance and the relationship between key features and the target variable.
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning application for house price prediction using a publicly available housing dataset. It helps users understand how various factors like the average number of rooms, crime rates, and accessibility to employment centers affect house prices.

Features
User Input: Allows users to specify values for various input parameters through sliders.
Prediction Output: Displays the predicted median value of homes (MEDV) in thousands of dollars.
Visualization: Includes interactive plots that show the distribution of house prices, relationships between key features and target variables, and feature importance using SHAP values.
Installation
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, shap, matplotlib, streamlit, seaborn, sklearn
Setting Up the Project
Clone the repository:



Usage
Input Parameters: Use the sidebar sliders to specify the values for different input parameters like the average number of rooms, crime rate, etc.
Prediction: The app will display the predicted median value of homes based on the input values.
Visualizations: The app will display:
The distribution of the target variable (MEDV).
A scatter plot showing the relationship between one feature (e.g., RM) and MEDV.
SHAP summary plot showing the importance of each feature in the prediction.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the app works:

Select input values for features like CRIM (crime rate) and RM (average number of rooms).
The model will predict the Median Value of Owner-Occupied Homes (MEDV) in thousands of dollars.
Visualizations will help you understand which features have the most impact on the prediction.
Example Output
Predicted Median Value of Homes: $25,000
Feature Importance: Graph showing which features (e.g., average number of rooms) contribute the most to the model's prediction.
